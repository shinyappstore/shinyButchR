ShinyButchR is an interactive R/Shiny app to perform NMF on an input matrix.Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been widely used for the analysis of genomic data to perform feature extraction and signature identification due to the interpretability of the decomposed signatures. ShinyButchR uses {ButchR} R package to run the matrix decomposition and generate diagnostic plots and visualizations that helps to find association of the NMF signatures to known biological factors.
